          <h2>VALUE PROPOSITION:</h2> The novel bioherbicide we developed is
          80%-100% effective in controlling the broomrapes, is lower in cost and
          is environmentally friendly which makes it widely accessible.

          <h2>PRODUCT EFFICACY: </h2>
          The research team succeeded in developing the first bioherbicide in
          the world to control the crenate broomrape. We have run experiments in
          farmers' fields with the bioherbicide and it has proven to provide
          excellent efficiency in reducing the germination and growth of the
          crenate broomrape.

          <h2>HOW IT WORKS:</h2> The bioherbicide contains fungal spores that
          are encapsulated in a natural carrier which protects the fungul spores
          from adverse conditions. The carrier also acts as a food substance
          that helps the fungus grow vigorously (when the bioherbicide is
          exposed to irrigation water) and aggressively attacks the broomrape
          seeds in the soil leading to their decomposition and thus their
          failure to germinate.
